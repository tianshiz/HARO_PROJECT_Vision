HARO_PROJECT_Vision
===================

The vision component of the HARO Project. Capable of learning new objects and classifying them autonomously. 
This repo hosts all the code I've written for this. However, it is not functional as is and requires the installation
of the following toolkits
-VLfeat
-GBVS(saliency mapper)
-KSLH toolbox
-Diehl-Incremental-SVM

Note this code was written for proof of concept and isn't adapted to be used by others than myself. However please feel 
free to reference the code inside.
